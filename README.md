# prevent-ad_dr8.1internal

All fMRI data procressing used for Prevent-AD internal data release 8.0.

The project used giga processing2 workflow.

The aim of the repository is to document the process, provide information to reproduce the process in principal, 
rather than a "ready to go" repository that can run on the dataset right out of the box.

Currently I am only planning on analysing wave 1.

## Data exlusion

- MTL0068 - Excluded due to data shape issue in preproecessing.
